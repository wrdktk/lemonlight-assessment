## Installation

## TODOS

The following are things I would want to improve/refactor or consider:

[] configure dev/prod environments and use/check for it in code where required
[] refactor for async/await
[] add authentication/jwt sessions to verify users on login
[] consider who and how many times our api can be accessed
[] add server logging (morgan)
[] sql procedures/scripts for creating/dropping db tables
[] controlled roles/persmissions for db users
[] use orm (sequelize)
[] use styled-components for CSS-in-JS (I prefer the explicit connect btwn css rules and html elements)
